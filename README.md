# 🔊 Acoustic Sensor Based Rail Road Defect Detection

[cite_start]This project proposes a **cost-effective and reliable** rail defect detection system that utilizes **acoustic wave technology** to identify cracks, fractures, and surface wear in real time[cite: 20].

##  The Problem

[cite_start]Traditional rail inspections are **manual, slow, and error-prone**[cite: 46]. [cite_start]Hidden rail defects compromise safety and the current methods lack real-time predictive capabilities[cite: 46].

##  Proposed Solution

[cite_start]The system is designed for **continuous monitoring** of railway tracks to enhance railway safety and enable **proactive maintenance**[cite: 21, 44].

### Key Technologies

The solution integrates the following components for an **IoT-enabled** monitoring system:

* [cite_start]**Acoustic Sensors (Piezoelectric & Ultrasonic):** Mounted on the tracks to capture sound and vibration patterns that change when defects occur (cracks, fractures, wear)[cite: 45, 62].
* [cite_start]**ESP32 Microcontroller:** Collects and processes the acoustic signals at the **edge**, reducing delay and improving real-time monitoring[cite: 45, 63].
* [cite_start]**LoRaWAN Communication:** Ensures **long-range, low-power** data transmission, making it suitable for remote railway networks[cite: 45, 64].

##  Goals & Outcomes

* [cite_start]**Goal:** Create a real-time rail defect detection and prediction system to improve safety and enable cost-effective, proactive maintenance[cite: 47].
* [cite_start]**Outcome:** Early warnings of defects, reduced inspection costs and downtime, and a new benchmark for transportation safety using IoT and edge computing[cite: 48, 65, 66].
