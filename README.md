#  Acoustic Sensor Based Rail Road Defect Detection

This project proposes a **cost-effective and reliable** rail defect detection system that utilizes **acoustic wave technology** to identify cracks, fractures, and surface wear in real time.

##  The Problem

Traditional rail inspections are **manual, slow, and error-prone**. Hidden rail defects compromise safety and the current methods lack real-time predictive capabilities.

##  Proposed Solution

The system is designed for **continuous monitoring** of railway tracks to enhance railway safety and enable **proactive maintenance**.

### Key Technologies

The solution integrates the following components for an **IoT-enabled** monitoring system:

* **Acoustic Sensors (Piezoelectric & Ultrasonic):** Mounted on the tracks to capture sound and vibration patterns that change when defects occur (cracks, fractures, wear).
* **ESP32 Microcontroller:** Collects and processes the acoustic signals at the **edge**, reducing delay and improving real-time monitoring.
* **LoRaWAN Communication:** Ensures **long-range, low-power** data transmission, making it suitable for remote railway networks.

##  Goals & Outcomes

* **Goal:** Create a real-time rail defect detection and prediction system to improve safety and enable cost-effective, proactive maintenance.
* **Outcome:** Early warnings of defects, reduced inspection costs and downtime, and a new benchmark for transportation safety using IoT and edge computing.
